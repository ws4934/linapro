- [x] 11.21 Record cache consistency assessment: this change does not add business caches or alter the authoritative data sources, cache keys, invalidation triggers, cross-instance synchronization mechanisms, or failure degradation strategies for plugin runtime cache, i18n resource cache, or WASM compilation cache
- [x] 11.22 Call `lina-review` for code and specification review

## Feedback

- [x] **FB-1**: Change the collaboration between host and plugin to stabilize the capability seam, and remove scattered plugin occupancy judgment and high-coupling branches.
- [x] **FB-2**: The 6 official source plugins must be completely implemented in `apps/lina-plugins/<plugin-id>/`, and aligned with the `plugin-demo-source` directory structure and explicit wiring method.
- [x] **FB-3**: Remove the `pkg` bridge module that is not used by any plugin or host code to avoid exposing invalid public interfaces.
- [x] **FB-4**: Recycle host private menu mount keys and official plugin management constants from `apps/lina-core/pkg/` to `internal/` to avoid `pkg` from carrying host management rules.
- [x] **FB-5**: `orgcap` capability seams are not sealed -- `internal/service/orgcap/orgcap.go` directly imports `deptsvc` and exposes `[]*deptsvc.TreeNode`; need to let `orgcap` own `DeptTreeNode` and let the host business layer completely stop importing `deptsvc`.
- [x] **FB-6**: Clean up residual artifacts -- remove empty directory `apps/lina-core/pkg/officialplugin/` and commented-only SQL stubs.
- [x] **FB-7**: Plugin frontend realization -- 6 plugins `frontend/pages/*.vue` are currently thin wrappers; need to physically migrate pages, pop-up windows, and client APIs to each plugin `frontend/`.
- [x] **FB-8**: The `api/`, `internal/controller/` and `internal/service/` of `dept/post/notice/loginlog/operlog/servermon` are still in `apps/lina-core/`; need to migrate into each plugin `backend/api` and `backend/internal/{controller,service}`.
- [x] **FB-9**: Explicit host boundary exception for `orgcap` -- the org capability seam continues to install by the host consumer plugin into `sys_dept/sys_post/sys_user_dept/sys_user_post` tables as a read-only/associative source of truth, but the exception must be explicitly declared.
- [x] **FB-10**: Stable `pkg/pluginservice/session` external contract -- remove the direct alias publishing of the `internal/service/session` type, replace it with the host's own independent DTO.
- [x] **FB-11**: Block the default fallback of the user page to the organization plugin frontend API.
- [x] **FB-12**: The system information page E2E needs to follow the backend dynamic metadata to verify current component descriptions.
- [x] **FB-13**: `TC0021c` depends on the fixed `testuser`; needs to be changed to a self-created user in the test and cleaned up.
- [x] **FB-14**: The backend database access of official source plugins needs to be uniformly switched to the `dao/do/entity` generated by the plugin's local `make dao`.
- [x] **FB-15**: `middleware_request_body_limit` still uses bare `g.Map` for unified error response; needs to be changed to `ghttp.DefaultHandlerResponse`.
- [x] **FB-16**: Remove the DML for organization, announcement, and other source plugin business tables in `apps/lina-core/manifest/sql/mock-data/`.
- [x] **FB-17**: Delete the host's `dao/do/entity` and direct table lookup logic for the organization plugin business table; provide implementation by `org-center` through the stable capability provider.
- [x] **FB-18**: Official source plugin business tables will be uniformly migrated to the `plugin_<plugin_id_snake_case>_` scope prefix.
- [x] **FB-19**: The official organization source plugin naming is adjusted from `org-management` to `org-center`.
- [x] **FB-20**: Single-table official source plugin business table names should not repeat the resource suffix.
- [x] **FB-21**: Synchronize the main specifications to the final table name and capability boundary description after plugin.
- [x] **FB-22**: Merge the mistakenly created active iteration `host-plugin-boundary-followup` back to the current iteration.
- [x] **FB-23**: Change the variadic constructor used for "optional dependencies" in the host business component to an explicit parameter signature.
- [x] **FB-24**: Change the permission menu filtering dependency of `role` on `plugin` to narrow interface injection.
- [x] **FB-25**: Host controller constructor does not synchronize explicit dependency injection signatures, causing `go test ./...` to fail.
- [x] **FB-26**: `TC0069` still uses the old organization association table for cleaning, causing E2E failures.
- [x] **FB-27**: Operation log needs to be changed to a source plugin that self-registers the audit link through the global HTTP middleware registrar.
- [x] **FB-28**: `pluginbridge`/`pluginhost` behavioral objects exposed to plugins need to be unified interfaces.
- [x] **FB-29**: Delete the `plugin.jobs` plugin general task processor capability; retain only the `plugin.cron` built-in scheduled task projection link.
- [x] **FB-30**: Delete the `http.request.after-auth` / `RegisterAfterAuthHandler` plugin extension points.
- [x] **FB-31**: `monitor-operlog` audit middleware needs to converge to the plugin `service` layer.
- [x] **FB-32**: Source plugin `service` directory hierarchy is not standardized; uniformly migrate to `backend/internal/service/`.
- [x] **FB-33**: Supplement the source plugin directory structure to the project specification.
- [x] **FB-34**: Log TraceID should be turned off by default, and support both `config.yaml` static switch and system parameter dynamic override.
- [x] **FB-35**: System menu types still use `"D"` / `"M"` / `"B"` strings scatteredly; need to converge into strongly typed constants.
- [x] **FB-36**: `monitor-operlog` still uses `1~6` integers to express operation types; need to change to semantic strings.
- [x] **FB-37**: The host workbench still has unreferenced old versions of `monitor-operlog` frontend pages and API copies.
- [x] **FB-38**: `pluginbridge` exposes unified guest controller scaffolding with generics and error classifiers.
- [x] **FB-39**: `plugin-demo-dynamic` controller template slimming down using `pluginbridge` new helpers.
- [x] **FB-40**: The dynamic plugin guest controller supports the typed req/res signature of the API DTO driver.
- [x] **FB-41**: Remove the `apimeta.Meta` compatibility layer of the dynamic plugin API DTO after upstream GoFrame fixes.
- [x] **FB-42**: Remove the `sys.logger.traceID.enabled` parameter configuration; the log TraceID switch is only controlled by `config.yaml`.
- [x] **FB-43**: The unified task scheduling interface document group name is changed to `Task Scheduling/Timed Tasks`, etc.
- [x] **FB-44**: Remove the extra `demo.control.enabled` switch and use whether `plugin.autoEnable` contains `demo-control` as the demo-mode switch.
- [x] **FB-45**: Expand the demo-control global middleware scope to `/*`, cover the full system request chain, and preserve the login whitelist.
- [x] **FB-46**: Fix the issue where removing `demo-control` from `plugin.autoEnable` still left write interception active at runtime.
- [x] **FB-47**: Allow install, uninstall, enable, and disable operations for plugins other than `demo-control` while demo mode is active.
- [x] **FB-48**: Add bugfix feedback test coverage requirements to the project specification and `lina-review` skill.
